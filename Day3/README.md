## What is S3 Bucket in AWS?

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
- S3 is commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as backup and restore, archiving, content distribution, and hosting static websites.

## What is IAM in AWS?

- IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It enables you to manage users, groups, and permissions to securely access and use AWS services and resources.

#### key components of IAM:

- Users
- Groups
- Roles
- Policies
  
- IAM Documentation: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA67CrBhC1ARIsACKAa8QO24yZlrPkHNhtrrjI1zqNu85WCpVUCJgiNaYEouhOX5HIRu1QUTsaAroQEALw_wcB&trk=858d3377-dc99-4b71-b7d9-dfbd53b3fb6c&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQiA67CrBhC1ARIsACKAa8QO24yZlrPkHNhtrrjI1zqNu85WCpVUCJgiNaYEouhOX5HIRu1QUTsaAroQEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651612429263!p!!g!!amazon%20iam!19836375022!146902912293">Click me</a>

## What is AWSCLI?

- The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a set of open-source command-line tools for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) services. It allows users to control and manage AWS services directly from the command line, rather than using the AWS Management Console.

## Tasks:
#### 1) Make a private S3 bucket in AWS and change the policy so you can access its stuff without making it public.<br>
> `Note:` Task1 will help you to understand how we can secure our S3 buckets.

#### 2) Configure AWSCLI on your Ubuntu machine.
   
#### 3) Create an EC2 instance using AWSCLI.<br>
> `Note:` Task3 will help you to understand AWSCLI more clearly.<br>
> `Hint:`Resource to complete task2: <a href="https://madhup.hashnode.dev/creating-an-ec2-instance-on-aws-using-awscli"> EC2 using AWSCLI</a>

#### 4) Setting Up AWS IAM for a New Team Member<br>
`Scenario:` Imagine you're working as an IT administrator at GlobalTech Inc., a multinational company with diverse cloud computing needs. The company heavily relies on AWS services for its operations. You have a new colleague, Alex, who recently joined your team. Alex's role involves monitoring the company's computing resources and managing data storage. Your task is to set up Alex's AWS access.<br>
  
  What needs to be done: 
  - Configure AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) to provide Alex with specific access rights. Alex should be able to:
    - View EC2 Instances: Alex needs to monitor the virtual servers running in the AWS cloud but should not be able to modify them.
    - Create S3 Buckets: Alex is responsible for creating new storage spaces for various projects.

> `Note:` Make a blog and post it on linkedIn.
