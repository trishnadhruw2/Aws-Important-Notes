# Task for Day4

## Tasks:
#### 1) Read about AWS RDS, DynamoDB and AWS lambda and write a post on linkedIn with example in your own words.
> `Note:` I have added documentation for reference below
#

#### 2) You are part of a team responsible for migrating the database of an existing e-commerce platform to Amazon RDS. The goal is to improve scalability, performance, and manageability. The current setup uses a self-managed MySQL database on an on-premises server. ðŸ‘‡

#### What needs to be done:
  - Set up and configure a MySQL database on AWS RDS, ensuring optimal performance.
  - Establish a connection between the RDS instance and your EC2 environment
#

#### 3) Deploy a scalable web application. The application consists of a MySQL database managed by Amazon RDS and a flask based web application that automatically scale based on demand using an Auto Scaling group and an Elastic Load Balancer. <br>

#### 4) Scenario:
You're an AWS expert managing a budget-friendly project with EC2 instances. To save money, you're using AWS Lambda to automatically start and stop instances when they're not needed during non-business hours. ðŸ‘‡

#### What needs to be done:
  - Create an AWS Lambda function that will start/stop instances based on their instance tag. <br>
> `Note`: learn about python boto3 to solve this task.
