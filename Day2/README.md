# Task for Day2

## What is AWS WAF?
- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a service that protects web applications from malicious attacks by filtering and monitoring incoming traffic based on defined rules. It safeguards against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more.

### Example:
If you have a web application hosted on AWS, you can use AWS WAF to set rules that block requests from specific IP addresses or patterns commonly associated with attacks.

## Tasks:
- Learn about AWS WAF and write a blog on linkedIn
- Try to implement below project and write a blog on it
## Project: 
- Implementing AWS WAF for Web Application Protection
### Scenario:
You need to secure a web application hosted on AWS against common web vulnerabilities using AWS WAF.
### Requirements:
### Set Up a Web Application:
- Deploy a sample web application on an EC2 instance in your AWS account.

### Configure AWS WAF:
- Create an AWS WAF WebACL to define rules for blocking malicious requests.

### Test AWS WAF:
- Generate test requests to the web application, including requests that match the defined WAF rules.
